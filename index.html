            <p>The double bass, also known simply as the bass (or by other names), is the largest and lowest-pitched bowed (or plucked) string instrument[1] in the modern symphony orchestra (excluding unorthodox additions such as the octobass).[2] The Double bass has a similar structure to the cello.
<br>
The bass is a standard member of the orchestra's string section,[3] as well as the concert band, and is featured in concertos, solo, and chamber music in Western classical music.[4] The bass is used in a range of other genres, such as jazz, 1950s-style blues and rock and roll, rockabilly, psychobilly, traditional country music, bluegrass, tango and folk music.
